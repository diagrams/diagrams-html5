Take any diagram and cut out an equilateral triangle of side 1 from the center. This is the traingle inside of the three mirrors that make up a kaleidescope. The image is created by first repeatedly refecting this triangle to make a hexagon. Then the image plane is tiled with this hexagon.I use a little bit of trickery to create the hexagon of reflected triangles. If you want to see what is really going on, examine the diagrams `ts !! 2` and `ts !! 1`.

> kaleid :: Dia -> Dia
> kaleid d = rotateBy (1/12) $ appends hex hexs
>   where
>     hexs = zip dirs (replicate 6 hex)
>     dirs = iterate (rotateBy (1/6)) unitX
>     hex = rotateBy (1/12) $
>             (ts !! 2 # centerXY)
>          <> (ts !! 1 # rotateBy (1/2) # snugT)
>     ts = iterate flipTurn (mkTriangle d)
>     flipTurn tri = (tri === tri # reflectY) # rotateBy (1/6)

> mkTriangle :: Dia -> Dia
> mkTriangle = clipped (triangle 1)

We pass as arguments the number of pieces of confetti `n` and a random seed `r`. Between 10 and 100 pieces seem to work nicely.

> kaleidescope :: Int -> Int -> Dia
> kaleidescope n r
>   = kaleid (mkConfetti n (mkStdGen r))
>           # centerXY <> (circle 2.75 # fc black)
>           # pad 1.1

To create and image to use in the kadeidescope we generate a bunch of disks with random location, size, color and opacity. This is the confetti used as the image. Of course using circles is arbitrary, any shapes and sizes will do.

> sizeValue :: (RandomGen g) => Rand g Double
> sizeValue = getRandomR (0.05, 0.25)

> coordValue :: (RandomGen g) => Rand g Double
> coordValue = getRandomR (-0.5, 0.5)

We use monadRandom to hide the plumbing of the many random numbers we need. The colors are choosen from the 330+ `webColors` from the package `Data.Colour.Palette.ColorSet`.

> confetti :: Int -> Rand StdGen Dia
> confetti n = do
>   ss <- replicateM n sizeValue   -- radius
>   cs <- replicateM n getRandom   -- color index
>   as <- replicateM n getRandom   -- opacity
>   xs <- replicateM n coordValue  -- x coordinate
>   ys <- replicateM n coordValue  -- y coordinate
>   let mkCirc :: Double -> Int -> Double -> Dia
>       mkCirc s c a = circle s # fc (webColors c) # opacity a # lw none
>       pos = zipWith mkP2 xs ys
>       conf = zipWith3 mkCirc ss cs as
>   return $ position (zip pos conf)

Make the confetti diagram and extract it from the monad.

> mkConfetti :: Int -> (StdGen -> Dia)
> mkConfetti n = evalRand $ confetti n
